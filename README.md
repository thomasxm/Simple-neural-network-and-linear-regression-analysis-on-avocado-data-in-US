# Simple-neural-network-and-linear-regression-analysis-on-avocado-data-in-US
In this project we will concentrate on the time series forecasting analysis of avocado prices over 4 years period within the US region. The analysis is performed with simple linear regression model and one hidden layer neural network to demonstrate the different aspects of the existing data, and highlighted the area of improvements need to be done. The LR and NN are implemented from scratch without using any high level packages like Pytorch and Tensorflow in order to demonstrate the implementing processes.
